# Sales Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing a sales dataset from a US-based online electronics store. The main objective is to clean the data and extract key insights to understand customer purchasing behavior and sales trends.

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed invalid rows, handled missing values, and converted columns to appropriate data types.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted relevant fields such as Month and City from existing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed monthly sales performance, city-wise revenue, and product sales trends.
- **Sales Insights**:
  - Identified the best month for sales.
  - Analyzed cities with the highest revenue.
  - Determined frequently sold product combinations.
- **Visualization**: Created bar plots, line plots, and heatmaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn to support findings.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
